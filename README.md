# Introduction

The mod adds the 'Set Owner' Gizmo (like from a Bed) onto all Workbenches.

Pawns can be explicitly assigned to the workbench. Multiple pawns can be assigned to the same bench.

If no pawns are assigned (default), then anybody can work the bench (default).

But if any pawns are assigned, then only those assigned pawns can work the bench.

This works independently from the bill restrictions, so make sure bills are not assigned to someone else.

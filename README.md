# Introduction

The mod adds the 'Set Owner' Gizmo (like from a Bed) onto all Workbenches.

Pawns will not work on the bench unless they are assigned to it.

This works separately from the bill restrictions, so make sure bills are not assigned to someone else.

Multiple pawns can be assigned at once.
